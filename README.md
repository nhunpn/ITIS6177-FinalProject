# üì∏ Image Analysis Proxy API Documentation

Analyze images effortlessly without the need for an Azure subscription. This API accepts an image URL and returns a detailed analysis using the Azure Computer Vision API (v3.2) so you do not need an Azure subscription or API key, this proxy API handles it for you.

## üìñ Overview
This API lets you connect to Microsoft‚Äôs Azure Computer Vision Image Analysis API via a simple endpoint without having to sign up for an account. In general, this API uses HTTP POST requests with JSON arguments and JSON responses.

## ‚è© Quick Start:
Here‚Äôs a quick way to start using the API:
1. Create a POST request to this endpoint in Postman: `http://157.245.249.190:3000/analyze`

 ```json
   {  
      "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"  
   }
```

3. Hit Send and receive a detailed image analysis.  
	Response example:
```json
